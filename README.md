# IGReg: Mitigating Gradient Conflicts for Multi-Task Glioma Phenotyping and Grading via Implicit Regularization

![IGReg Network Architecture](IGreg.jpg)

This repository provides the **PyTorch implementation** of the paper:  
**"Mitigating Gradient Conflicts for Multi-Task Glioma Phenotyping and Grading via Implicit Regularization (IGReg)"**.

## Method Overview

IGReg integrates two plug-and-play modules into a standard multi-task learning (MTL) framework:

### 1. Dynamic Prototype Alignment (DPA)
- Constructs a semantic prototype space using an **auxiliary segmentation dataset** (different from the glioma multi-task classification dataset).
- Aligns task-specific features from the MTL framework with relevant prototypes via contrastive learning.
- Enhances feature consistency and reduces task-specific gradient noise.

### 2. Surrogate Task-Dominant Gradient Projection (STDGP)
- Preserves the dominant gradient direction for the current task by orthogonally projecting gradients from other tasks.
- Ensures the extracted features remain highly discriminative.
- Introduces a conditional regularization loss to enforce similarity between high-confidence surrogate-derived features and primary classification features.

## Backbone Network
The backbone of IGReg is adapted from the [MA-MTLN](https://github.com/infinite-tao/MA-MTLN) architecture proposed in:

(2021). 3D multi-attention guided multi-task learning network for automatic gastric tumor segmentation and lymph node classification. *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, 40(6), 1618â€“1631.

## Data & Preprocessing
- The **auxiliary segmentation dataset** used in the DPA module comes from a source different from the glioma multi-task classification dataset, and is specifically introduced to alleviate gradient noise across tasks.
- Data acquisition, preprocessing, and base model construction follow our previously released code:
